                      <p>Cocoa farming is a major contributor to the economies of several West African countries. The last piece of chocolate you ate likely had its roots in West Africa, where two-thirds of cocoa beans are produced. </p>
                      <p>Most likely it’s grown up in Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire) where cocoa sales accounting for approximately 10% of the country's GNP.</p>

                      <h2>Ivory Coast</h2>
                      <p>In 2019 four west African countries produce 74% of the world’s supply, among them Ivory Coast occupies 60% of total.</p>
                      <p>A century ago, the introduction of cocoa farming brought many economic opportunities to this land, also marking the beginning of deforestation. Ivory coast is gifted with an advantageous location in the forest belt where the savanna reaches down to the sea and the seasonal dryness of the climate precludes the planting of drought-sensitive crops like cocoa. It has the highest level of biodiversity in West Africa. As of 2016, 252 species of mammal, 666 species of bird, 153 species of reptile, 80 species of amphibian, 671 species of fish and 3660 species of vascular plant had been recorded in Ivory Coast. While the majority of Ivory Coast’s forests exist as small, fragmented forest islands, most of these areas are designated as national parks and protected forest reserves. </p>
